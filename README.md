<h1>Hand Tracking with Volume Control using PyCaw</h1>

This repository extends the functionality of the previous HandTracking repository by introducing the PyCaw library, developed by AndreMiras. PyCaw is a Python Cydia API Wrapper, specifically designed for Python Core Audio on Windows systems. 
This addition allows for volume control using hand gestures alongside hand tracking.

Please note that since PyCaw is a Windows-based library, this code will not generate output on Mac systems.


<h3><b>Installation</b></h3>

1. Install the required dependencies by running:
  ``` pip install -r requirements.txt ```

2. Install PyCaw using pip:
   ``` pip install pycaw ```

<h3><b>Usage</b></h3>
Once all dependencies are correctly installed, simply run Gesture_Volume.py. This will activate the camera, and the program will start running.

<h3><b>Sample Output</b></h3>
Check out the sample output video in the repository to see the volume control in action.
